## What is Machine Learning?
#### Machine learning, a subset of data science, is the scientific study of computational algorithms and statistical models to perform specific tasks through patterns and inference instead of explicit instructions. Machine learning can be described as a set of tools to build models on data. Data scientists explore data, select and build models (machine), tune parameters such that a model fits observations (learning), then use the model to predict and understand aspects of new unseen data.
#### Machine learning is a set of tools used to build models on data. Building models to understand data and make predictions is an important part of a data scientists' job.

## Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
#### In Machine Learning, we talk about supervised and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning is when we have a known target (also called label) based on past data (for example, predicting what price a house will sell for) and unsupervised learning is when there isnâ€™t a known past answer (for example, determining the topics discussed in restaurant reviews).
#### In this module we will explore Linear Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm. In the modules to come we will also explore another supervised machine learning algorithm, classification, as well as an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, clustering.

## Scikit-learn
#### Scikit-learn, one of the best known machine learning libraries in python for machine learning, implements a large number of commonly used algorithms. Regardless of the type of algorithm, the syntax follows the same workflow: import > instantiate > fit > predict. Once the basic use and syntax of Scikit-learn is understood for one model, switching to a new algorithm is straightforward. Thus for the rest of the course we will be working with scikit-learn to build machine learning models in different use cases.
#### In this module, we learn how to predict housing prices in Boston, USA using linear regression.
#### In addition to a set of algorithms, scikit-learn also provides a few small datasets used by the machine learning community to benchmark algorithms on data that comes from the real world, such as boston house-prices dataset that we will be using through this module, iris dataset for classification task in the next, etc.
